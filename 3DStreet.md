## Experimenting with 3DStreet and streetmix
I took some time to create my "ideal city street" using https://streetmix.net/.

Here is a link to the street that I created on streetmix: 
https://streetmix.net/srothst1/1/sams-ideal-street. I took inspiration from various of my favorite quaint neighborhoods in Half Moon Bay, CA. Here is a photo for reference.

I appropriately named the street that I created Sam's Street :grinning: :+1:

Next, I used [3DStreet](https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet/#a-frame-street-component-api) to visualize this street in 3D using [aframe](https://aframe.io/)

Clearly, the 3DStreet repository does not support cyclists, food trucks, etc. However, this process was really enjoyable and certainly a proof of concept for city planers and folks interested in urban development.
