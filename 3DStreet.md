## Experimenting with 3DStreet and streetmix
I took some time to create my "ideal city street" using [streetmix](https://streetmix.net/).

Here is a link to the street that I created on streetmix:

Feel free to check it out and provide feedback. I went for form over function. My primary goal was to create a pleasant and welcoming environment. 

I took inspiration from various of my favorite quaint neighborhoods in Half Moon Bay, CA. Here is a photo for reference.

I appropriately named the street that I created Sam's Street :grinning: :+1:

Next, I used [3DStreet](https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet/#a-frame-street-component-api) to visualize this street in 3D using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)

Clearly, the 3DStreet repository does not support cyclists, food trucks, etc. However, this process was really enjoyable and certainly a proof of concept for city planers and folks interested in urban development.  


I also investigated "free roam" camera controls. I think first-person camera controls really adds to the user experience. Here is a quick video that I put together that showcases the user experience: [https://youtu.be/H63M3es3FNo](https://youtu.be/H63M3es3FNo). Here is an image showcasing a more complete city street.
